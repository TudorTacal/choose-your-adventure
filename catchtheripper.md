CATCH THE RIPPER!

In 1888, as summer slipped away, and days grew shorter and nights longer and colder, a ruthless serial killer stalked the vice-ridden streets of East London, slaughtering women with gruesome abandon and eerie stealth. To this day, his identity remains a mystery. We only know the names of his victims… and that he called himself Jack the Ripper.

This adventure transports you back in time and will guide you around the Ripper’s haunts. You have the chance to catch him in the act, stop him in his tracks and discover his identity once and for all… but can you survive when so many have met a bloody end?

SPITALFIELDS MARKET

Mary Ann "Polly" Nichols, 43, a domestic servant and possible prostitute, is seen leaving a pub near Spitalfields, drunk and short of the fourpence required for a bed for the night.

"I've had my doss money three times today and spent it,"  she said, planning to earn what she required on the street, with the help of her new bonnet.

Polly is widely believed to be the Ripper’s first victim — unless you can stop him in time.

His other suspected victims were "Dark Annie" Chapman (47), Elizabeth "Long Liz" Stride (45), Catherine "Kate" Eddowes (46) and
"Black Mary" Jane Kelly (25).

If you can track down these women before they meet the Ripper, you might be able to save them and solve the mystery.

If you want to take the risky route, go to DURWARD STREET

If you’d like to play it safe, go to BRICK LANE.
```
```
DURWARD STREET (FORMERLY BUCK'S ROW)

You discover Polly on the ground.

You’re too late.

Despite her reputation for drinking and her reduced circumstances, she was well-liked by all that knew her. She is survived by five children, and had been separated from her husband William for seven years by this time, after 24 years of marriage.

According to her father,  "I don't think she had any enemies, she was too good for that."

As the crowds gather around the scene, one onlooker says he saw a mysterious figure follow two women towards CHRIST CHURCH, SPITALFIELDS.

Another says a man with a sinister package was seen heading towards THRAWL STREET.

Follow your gut. Just don't get them spilled.

```
BRICK LANE

There’s no sign of Polly, so you grab a pint at The Frying Pan Public House on the corner of Brick Lane and Thrawl Street, and chat to fellow customers. There is a growing sense of foreboding amongst the drunken patrons. Women keep disappearing and suffering attacks, the streets are becoming more dangerous each night.

East London is a busy place, full of commercial and criminal activity, with many arriving from the nearby docks and looking for ways to make a living whatever way they can. But even with so many coming and going, similar reports of a dark figure creeping along the streets keep cropping up as the beer, whisky and rum flow into dirty glasses and down desperate throats.

You hear that ALDGATE HIGH STREET is a hotbed of criminal activity and the go-to place to find out more about suspicious characters.

Or, if you fancy getting a few rounds in and talking to more loose-lipped locals, visit THE TEN BELLS, another popular public house.

```
CHRIST CHURCH, SPITALFIELDS

As the majestic and imposing white church comes into view, you see two women brawling in the street.

One is DARK ANNIE, the other Eliza Cooper. Both are residents of Crossingham's Lodging House on Dorset Street - the worst street in London. Both are said to be the lover of Edward Stanley, a bricklayer's mate.

But the women say they are fighting over soap, not a man.

Dark Annie throws a penny at Eliza, and says "Think yourself lucky I did not do more", before stalking off with a black eye.

In the excitement, you lose sight of Dark Annie, but a witness to the fight says she was heading to THE OLD TRUMAN BREWERY.

Another says she was likely heading to Crossingham's via BRUSHFIELD STREET.

```

```
THRAWL STREET (FORMERLY FLOWER AND DEAN STREET)

You are at 32 Flower and Dean Street, a common-lodging house within a notorious criminal rookery. A middle-aged man with a neat mustache knocks on the front door and is greeted by a solemn young woman.

"Good evening, Dr Barnado," she says. He is the famous Irish philanthropist and is here to better understand how to save children from the street.

You follow him into the kitchen, where a group of women are discussing the recent spate of murders. One woman cries "We're all up to no good, no one cares what becomes of us! Perhaps some of us will be killed next!"

Among the huddle in the kitchen is LONG LIZ.

She is noted for her Swedish accent, light gray eyes and curly hair. Fellow lodgers describe her as a quiet woman who would do a "good turn for anyone", although she has frequently appeared before the Thames Magistrate Court on charges of being drunk and disorderly, sometimes with obscene language.

The discussion of the murders continues with increasing excitement and fear, but Long Liz seems to have other things on her mind. She buttons up her coat and heads for the door.

You decide to follow her, but are intercepted by the woman who let Dr Barnado in.

"Who are you?", she asks, suspiciously.

A friend of Long Liz, you say. You have come to lend her money, which she requires urgently.

"Very well," says the woman, raising an eyebrow. "Then go to THE OLD TRUMAN BREWERY or HENRIQUES STREET, she'll be at one or the other tonight."

You're not sure if you believe her, but since you are no longer able to follow Long Liz directly, you must decide where to go next.
```
```
ALDGATE HIGH STREET

You arrive to find KATE lying drunk in the road on Aldgate High Street. She is dead drunk, but not dead. Yet.

Kate has hazel eyes and dark auburn hair. Friends speak of her as an intelligent, scholarly woman with a fierce temper. She has a talent for gallows ballads, and once hawked such a ballad at the hanging of her cousin in Stratford.

You go to help Kate to her feet, but are beaten to the punch by PC Louis Robinson, who takes her into custody and detains her in a cell until she is deemed sober. She gives her name as "Mary Ann Kelly of 6 Fashion Street", although she is in fact a resident of Cooney's Lodging House, 55 Flower and Dean Street.

You wish to speak to her upon her release. She charges ahead, ignoring you, clearly not quite as sober as she claims.

You ask the duty policeman about where she might be headed, claiming to be a friend of the family and concerned for her welfare.

He raises an eyebrow but recommends you head to either THE OLD TRUMAN BREWERY or MITRE SQUARE.
```

```
THE TEN BELLS

It's 5.30am, but the public house is still buzzing with activity.

You get yourself a rum and look around for a place to sit. A woman, already visibly drunk, catches your eye and beckons you over, indicating that you should bring her a drink too. You oblige.

Her name is Elizabeth Prater, and she says her day of drinking has begun so early because she was awoken by the cry of "Oh murder!", back at her lodgings in Miller's Court (just off Dorset Street, the worst street in London), about an hour earlier.

"But it's a common thing to hear, in these parts," she says, before launching into a tirade about her neighbour, BLACK MARY, a young Irish woman with a Welsh accent. "Arguing with her fellow, again," Elizabeth complains.

You ask where Mary might be at this time.

Elizabeth says she'll either be back at at Miller's Court in what is now BRUSHFIELD STREET or with friends in HENRIQUES STREET.
```

```
THE OLD TRUMAN BREWERY

As you approach the brewery, you see a figure upon the ground near a doorway. You get closer and light your torch to see better. It's Dark Annie.

Suddenly a shadow falls across Dark Annie's body and before you can turn around, it's too late. You're...

DEAD!
```

```
HENRIQUES STREET (FORMERLY DUTFIELD'S YARD)

You arrive just in time to see Long Liz grappling with a cloaked man in the shadows. You yell out. The man lets Long Liz go, and comes towards you, brandishing a knife.

You scream as loudly as possible, attracting the attention of the patrons of the nearby International Worker's Educational Club, a place frequented by Russian, Jewish, British, French, Italian, Czech and Polish radicals.

As the revellers begin to spill out of the club to investigate the commotion you have created, the man slips down a dark alleyway.

You and Long Liz are both safe, but you are none the wiser about the identity of the Ripper.

That was a...

CLOSE CALL!
```


```
MITRE SQUARE

You see Kate talking to a man, one hand placed upon his chest, but not in a way that suggests she is threatened by him.

However, you can see the handle of the knife that he is beginning to pull out of his coat pocket, so you dash towards them, hoping to catch him off-guard and disarm him.

You manage to snatch his knife, push Kate to safety, and get a good look at the man's face before he runs off into the night. He is unremarkable in every way, but you have enough detail to give Scotland Yard.

Mystery...

SOLVED! BUT THE RIPPER GETS AWAY!
```

```
BRUSHFIELD STREET (formerly MILLER'S COURT)

You can hear a woman crying out with fear as you approach the lodging-house so you pick up the pace and rush through the building, until you find Mary struggling with a man in her bedroom.

You pick up a lamp and bang him over the head with it, rendering him unconscious. You and Mary remove his array of grisly instruments and tie him him to the bed with plenty of rope. Time to call Scotland Yard.

Well done, you've...

CAUGHT THE RIPPER!
