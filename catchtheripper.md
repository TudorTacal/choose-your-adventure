CATCH THE RIPPER!

More than a century ago, a ruthless serial killer stalked the streets of East London, slaughtering women with eerie precision. To this day, his identity remains a mystery. We only know the names of his victims… and that he called himself Jack the Ripper.

This adventure transports you back to 1888 and will guide you around the Ripper’s haunts. You have the chance to catch him in the act, stop him in his tracks and discover his identity once and for all… but can you survive when so many have met a bloody end?

SPITALFIELDS MARKET
Mary Ann Nichols, 43, a domestic servant and possible prostitute, is seen leaving a pub near Spitalfields, drunk and short of the fourpence required for a bed for the night. She has reportedly said she plans to earn this on the street, with the help of her new bonnet.

She is widely believed to be the Ripper’s first victim — unless you can stop him in time.
